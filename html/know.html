                    Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that affects communication, behavior, and social interaction. It is estimated that 1 in 36 children are diagnosed with ASD, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html" target="_blank">CDC's latest data</a>. Autism presents differently in each individual, ranging from highly verbal to non-verbal, and often involves unique strengths alongside challenges. Understanding the diversity within the spectrum is essential to foster acceptance and provide appropriate support.

                    ASD is usually identified in early childhood, though it can be diagnosed at any age. Early diagnosis and intervention can help improve learning and development. Autism is not a disease and cannot be cured, but with proper support, individuals with autism can lead fulfilling lives.

                    People with autism may have different sensory experiences, such as being more sensitive to sounds, lights, or touch. These sensory differences can sometimes cause discomfort or anxiety. Understanding these unique responses is important for creating supportive environments, both at home and in schools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Autism affects individuals across all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. It is important to recognize and respect the wide range of abilities and needs within the autism community. Encouraging acceptance and providing appropriate accommodations helps people with autism participate fully in society.
