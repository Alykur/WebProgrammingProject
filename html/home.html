                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/autism-spectrum-disorders">Autism spectrum disorders (ASD)</a> are a diverse group of conditions. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>, they are characterized by some degree of difficulty with social interaction and communication. 
                    Other characteristics are atypical patterns of activities and behaviors, such as difficulty with transition from one activity to another, a focus on details, and unusual reactions to sensations.

                Autism affects about 1 in 100 children worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Early intervention and support can make a significant difference in the lives of individuals with autism and their families.
