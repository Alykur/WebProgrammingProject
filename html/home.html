                    are a diverse group of conditions. According to the  World Health Organization (WHO), they are characterized by varying levels of difficulty with social interaction and communication, as well as atypical patterns of behavior and activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Individuals with ASD may experience challenges transitioning between activities, heightened focus on details, and unique responses to sensory input. Understanding and support are essential for creating inclusive environments.

                    At Neuro'Educ, we strive to break down misconceptions and promote strategies that celebrate neurodiverse perspectives in everyday life and education.
