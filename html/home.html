                <p>
                The mission of Neuro’Educ is to provide up-to-date, general information on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD).
                By providing support to individuals with autism and their families, Neuro’Educ serves autistic women and men, their loved ones, and more broadly, anyone seeking to learn about autism.

                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/autism-spectrum-disorders">Autism spectrum disorders (ASD)</a> are a diverse group of conditions. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>, they are characterized by some degree of difficulty with social interaction and communication. 
                    Other characteristics are atypical patterns of activities and behaviors, such as difficulty with transition from one activity to another, a focus on details, and unusual reactions to sensations.
