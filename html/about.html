                <h2>Raising Awareness About Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>
                <p>
                    Neuro'Educ was founded with a clear mission: to educate and sensitize the public about Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). 
                    We believe that understanding and acceptance begin with education. Through our comprehensive resources, we aim to 
                    dispel myths, challenge stereotypes, and promote a more inclusive society where neurodivergent individuals can thrive. 
                    Our platform provides evidence-based information, personal testimonies, and practical resources for families, educators, 
                    and communities to better understand and support individuals with autism.

            <h1>Why Neuro'Educ Matters</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>Breaking Down Barriers Through Education</h2>
                <p>
                    Autism affects approximately 1 in 100 children worldwide, yet misconceptions and stigma continue to create barriers 
                    for individuals and families. Many people still hold outdated beliefs about autism, leading to discrimination and 
                    exclusion. Neuro'Educ addresses this challenge by providing accessible, accurate information that helps people 
                    understand autism as a neurological difference, not a deficit. We emphasize the unique strengths and perspectives 
                    that autistic individuals bring to our communities, while also acknowledging the support they may need to navigate 
                    a world designed for neurotypical minds.

            <h1>Our Approach</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>Multi-faceted Educational Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    Neuro'Educ employs a comprehensive approach to autism awareness and education. We provide essential knowledge about 
                    autism characteristics, early signs, and intervention strategies. Our platform features authentic testimonies from 
                    autistic individuals and their families, offering real-world perspectives on living with autism. We curate valuable 
                    resources including research articles, support organizations, and practical tools. Additionally, our interactive 
                    quiz helps visitors test their understanding and identify areas where they can learn more. This multi-faceted 
                    approach ensures that our content reaches diverse audiences and learning preferences.

            <h1>Our Vision for the Future</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>Creating an Inclusive World</h2>
                <p>
                    We envision a world where autism is understood, accepted, and valued. A world where autistic individuals have equal 
                    opportunities to participate in education, employment, and community life. Through Neuro'Educ, we're working to create 
                    environments where differences are celebrated rather than stigmatized. We believe that when society embraces 
                    neurodiversity, everyone benefits from the unique perspectives, talents, and contributions that autistic individuals 
                    bring. Our goal is to foster empathy, understanding, and practical support that enables autistic people to live 
                    fulfilling lives while being authentically themselves.
