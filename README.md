## üí° Project Overview

In a world where misinformation and outdated perspectives on autism can unfortunately still prevail, Neuro'Educ aims to be a trusted beacon of accurate, compassionate, and empowering information. We believe that education is the cornerstone of acceptance and that by understanding neurodiversity, we can build stronger, more supportive communities for everyone.

This project serves as the central hub for Neuro'Educ's educational initiatives, providing a user-friendly and reliable resource for anyone seeking to learn more about autism.
